{{ $NEXT }}

  [Changed]

  - The 'quiet' option now defaults to false.  This is less surprising
    to people, as any errors will be visible by default.

  [Fixed]

  - If an exception is caught, the module now changes to the original
    directory before any tempfiles are cleaned up.

  [Changed]

  - If iterating a distribution throws an exception, it will be caught
    and a warning issued instead.  This prevents an error from interrupting
    an entire run.

  - If the extracted directory lacks an executable permission, try
    chmod +x before chdir into it.
