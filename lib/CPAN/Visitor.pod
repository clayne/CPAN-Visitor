=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use CPAN::Visitor;
     my $visitor = CPAN::Visitor->new( cpan => "/path/to/cpan" );
 
     # Prepare to visit all distributions
     $visitor->select(); 
 
     # Or a subset of distributions
     $visitor->select(
       subtrees => [ qr{D/DA}, qr{A/AD} ], # relative to authors/id/
       exclude => qr{/Acme-},              # No Acme- dists
       match => qr{/Test-}                 # Only Test- dists
     );
 
     # Action is specified via a callback
     $visitor->iterate(
       visit => sub {
         my $job = shift;
         print $job->{distfile} if -f 'Build.PL'
       }
     );
 
     # Or start with a list of files
     $visitor = CPAN::Visitor->new(
       cpan => "/path/to/cpan",
       files => \@distfiles,     # e.g. ANDK/CPAN-1.94.tar.gz
     );
     $visitor->iterate( visitor => \&callback );
 
     # Iterate in parallel
     $visitor->iterate( visitor => \&callback, jobs => 5 );
