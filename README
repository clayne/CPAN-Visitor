    CPAN::Visitor - Generic traversal of distributions in a CPAN repository

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS
         use CPAN::Visitor;
         my $visitor = CPAN::Visitor->new( cpan => "/path/to/cpan" );
 
         # Prepare to visit all distributions
         $visitor->select(); 
 
         # Or a subset of distributions
         $visitor->select(
           subtrees => [ qr{D/DA}, qr{A/AD} ], # relative to authors/id/
           exclude => qr{/Acme-},              # No Acme- dists
           match => qr{/Test-}                 # Only Test- dists
         );
 
         # Action is specified via a callback
         $visitor->iterate(
           visit => sub {
             my $job = shift;
             print $job->{distfile} if -f 'Build.PL'
           }
         );
 
         # Or start with a list of files
         $visitor = CPAN::Visitor->new(
           cpan => "/path/to/cpan",
           files => \@distfiles,     # e.g. ANDK/CPAN-1.94.tar.gz
         );
         $visitor->iterate( visitor => \&callback );
 
         # Iterate in parallel
         $visitor->iterate( visitor => \&callback, jobs => 5 );

DESCRIPTION
    A very generic, callback-driven program to iterate over a CPAN
    repository.

    Needs much more documentation.

USAGE
    TBD.
